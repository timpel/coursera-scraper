# coursera-scraper

This is a script that tells you how long it will take to watch all the videos in a Coursera class in which you are enrolled.

To use it, run it in the command line, like this:

`python scraper.py <file.html>`

Where `<file.html>` is an HTML file containing the source code of the video list (you have to get this part yourself by going to the 'Video Lectures' page in your course and viewing/saving the HTML source). The script will spit out the total duration of all the videos, formatted as hh:mm:ss.
